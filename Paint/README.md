Project specifications
<div>The goal of this project is to develop a graphical paint application. The program will take mouse input from the user to create drawings on a blank canvas. Several types of drawing tools will be available, including a bucket fill, pencil, brush, and eraser. The user will be able to pick from a range of colors for each tool.<div>
<br>
<dvi>The software should be designed using the object-oriented programming paradigm so that the code can easily be modified, extended, and scaled by other developers. It is equally important to provide sufficient internal documentation to help other developers understand the code and encourage them to contribute to its development.<div>
