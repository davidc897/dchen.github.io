Hi, welcome to my GitHub home page. 
<div> I studied computer science at California State University Fullerton. <div>
<div> Here are some of my academic projects: <div>
<br>
<div> <i>Tuffix Paint Program</i>: a paint program designed similar to the Windows Paint using object-oriented programming and event listener in C++. <div>
<br>
<div> <i>University Database Program</i>: a data base program with ER diagram designed based on university mini world, created SQL database hosted on CSUF ECS server with front-end web for data retrieval in HTML and PHP. <div>
<br>
<div> <i>OS IPC Program</i>: A provider program and a consumer program open a shared memory location for data sharing with semaphore, and provider program contains zoom meeting minutes extracted from local file source, and consumer extracts the zoom meeting minutes through shared memory from provider and compute the total minutes for each participant. <div>
<br>
<div> <i>Algorithm Sorting Visualization</i>: a program that visualize sorting algorithm written in python with matplotlib. <div>
<br>
<div> <i>TCP/UDP Program</i>: a python program demonstrates client and server communicate interaction, the client sends data to the server using UDP and server responds back to the client with message and round-trip time. <div>
<br>
<div> <i>SpongeBob TV Show Database Program</i>: a database program that stored SpongBob TV Show data using SQLite and developed front-end retrieval and API to consume JSON data from other source. <div>
<br>
<div> <i>Reverse Polish Notation Program</i>: a program that follows Reverse Polish Notation that allows program to follow mathematical PEMDAS calculation rule. <div>
<br>
<div> <i>Pacman Project</i>: a Pacman game project in python, with DFS and BFS and other search algorithm implemented for the Pacman search agent for maze navigation / basic computer vision. <div>
<br>
<div> <i>ML Program</i>: a ML program to classify digits and type of language in python. <div>
